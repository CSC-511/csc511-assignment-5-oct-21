This README outlines the details of collaborating on this Ember application.

This is a Cost Breakdown Calculator much like the SplitWise Application.
This application uses Ember and multiple helpers to determine the average price based on the users input.
From that input it is determined how much each person owes. 
A login and sign up page have been added. These inputs are stored using local storage. 
Users can signup and then login with their usernamen and password.
