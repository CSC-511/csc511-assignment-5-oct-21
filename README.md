Assignment 5

This application was developed to add participants and split the cost between each user.
each participant can add a spending event which they are allowed to have as many as they would like. 
Updated so that a user now needs to make an account in the login page and sign in to use the calculator.
For each name or spending event added the total is shown for the total spent and how much each participant had paid and owes to the group.
If any participants are deleted their events are automatically removed and the calculations are redone to reflect to updated results.
These results will remain because of the use of localstorage so that refreshing the page should not reset the values,
A delete account clear account and sign out account button was added and uses the local storage to implement these functions.
